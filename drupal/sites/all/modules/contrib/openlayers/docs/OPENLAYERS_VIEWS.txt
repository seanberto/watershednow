# Filtering map views

The best way to handle filtering the points on maps is to use normal OpenLayers
exposed filters, whose input is passed through to the underlying Data
view. If there are no other views on the same page, like tabular listings, 
that can 'own' and display the exposed filters, it is recommended to make the 
filters blocks via the views interface and make sure that they appear on 
the specified page with the block system or context module.
