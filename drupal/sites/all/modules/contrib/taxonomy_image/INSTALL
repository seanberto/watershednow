The following are instructions on how to install and configure the
taxonomy_image.module:

INSTALLATION:

Step 1)
  Properly configure Drupal's built in file system support by following the
  directions at 'administer >> settings' in the File system settings area.
  Taxonomy Image will create another directory within the default file directory.


Step 2)
  Untar (or unzip) the Taxonomy Image module files into a
  'taxonomy_image' subdirectory within your appropriate 'modules' directory.


Step 3)
  Enable the taxonomy_image module.

  Go to "administer >> site building >> modules" and put a check mark in the
  'enabled' column next to 'taxonomy_image'.  This will automatically create
  the necessary database table.


Step 4)
  Enable permissions appropriate to your site.

  The taxonomy_image.module provides three permissions:
   - 'access taxonomy images': allow user to see taxonomy images.
   - 'administer taxonomy images': allow user to configure taxonomy images.
   - 'can  disable taxonomy images': allow user to disable taxonomy images.

  Note that you need to enable 'access taxonomy images' for users that
should see the taxonomy images.


Step 5)
  Configure the taxonomy_image module.

  Go to "administer >> settings >> taxonomy_image" to configure the module.
If you properly followed Step 0 above, this module will automatically create
the 'picture image path' which defaults to 'files/category_pictures'.  You can
also configure the module to force pictures to be within a certain size,
automatically resizing if needed.

  If you're using taxonomy hierarchies, and you wish to assign one image to
an entire tree of terms, enable 'recursive image display'.  If you're not
sure what this means, don't enable this option.


Step 6)
  Associate taxonomy terms with images. This is done within the normal term edit page.


Step 7)
  NOTE: This may not be needed. See the documentation pages for the add-on
    features. These add-ons are designed to largely eliminate the need for
    any theme changes.

  Update your theme or other php code to display taxonomy images.

  To display a taxonomy image from your theme or other php code, add
a call to taxonomy_image_display().  This function requires that you pass
in the term id of the term for which you wish to display the appropriate
image.  For example:
   taxonomy_image_display($term->tid)

  This will return an <img> tag with the appropriate values for source=,
height=, width= and alt=.  For example, it may return something like:
   <img src="files/image.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="term name" title="term name" />

  If you wish to set other img attributes, you can pass them in through a
second (optional) function paramter.  For example, to put a 2 pixel border
around the images being displayed and to set the alt text, you could call as
follows:
   taxonomy_image_display($term->tid, array('border' => "2", 'target' => 'new'))

  This would then return the following <img> tag:
   <img src="files/image.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="term name"
     title="term name" border="2" target="new" />

  See the included theme patches (in the 'contributed' folder) for more
examples.
