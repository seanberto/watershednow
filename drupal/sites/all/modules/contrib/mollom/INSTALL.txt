To install and configure the Drupal Mollom module:

 1. Download the Mollom module from http://drupal.org/project/mollom or http://mollom.com/download.
    Be sure to pick a version of the Mollom client that matches your version of Drupal. The module
    package should be placed with the rest of your contributed Drupal modules (generally,
    in "sites/all/modules" or "sites/default/modules").

 2. Go to http://mollom.com.

 3. Login with your Mollom.com account, or create an account if you don't have one.

 4. Select "Manage sites" from the upper right menu at Mollom.com.

 5. Select "Add subscription" to create a new key pair for your website (or "edit subscription" to
    access a subscription for an existing site tied to your account).

 6. Visit your site's module list (Administer >> Site building >> Modules) and enable the Mollom module.

 7. Visit your site's Mollom settings page (Administer >> Site configuration >> Mollom) and enter the key
    pair associated with your site (from step 5).

 8. Review the other Mollom settings and adjust as necessary.
